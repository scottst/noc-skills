Backend Data Error

Unable to connect to the back-end service at http://localhost:24080/list

The Java Application that should be listening on 24080 is not running for some reason.

Did find the Python and Mongo applications running and appear to be listening on the right ports

The startup script /etc/init.d/NocSkillsAPI is not running
Starting the NocSkillsAPI fails with the error

Starting NocSkillsAPI: cat: /var/run/NocSkillsAPI.pid: No such file or directory
The NocSkillsAPI is responsible for starting the Java app

I'm certain the PID file creation is the hangup but my research so far has not given me a 
clear enough understanding on how to fix the script.
